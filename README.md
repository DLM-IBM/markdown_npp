# markdown_npp

## Overview

This project provides a very simple user-defined language file for Notepad++ that does some basic syntax highlighting for Markdown texts. It does **not** render text from Markdown into HTML (but there are scripts that can do that, too, Google is your friend).

@ianchanning additions: Created Twilight theme, imported Zenburn theme from [@Edditoria's fork](https://github.com/Edditoria/markdown_npp_zenburn)  
@Hyzual additions: Created Obsidian theme

## Usage

Notepad++ allows you to add new languages by adding language definitions to a userDefineLang.xml file. Add the Markdown definition like this:

1. Download the Markdown language definition file 
   [default theme](https://raw.github.com/thomsmits/markdown_npp/master/default_theme/userDefineLang.xml)
   | [debug theme](https://raw.github.com/thomsmits/markdown_npp/master/debug_theme/userDefineLang.xml)
   | [Twilight theme](https://raw.github.com/thomsmits/markdown_npp/master/twilight_theme/userDefineLang.xml)
   | [Zenburn theme](https://raw.github.com/thomsmits/markdown_npp/master/zenburn_theme/userDefineLang.xml)
   | [Obsidian theme](https://raw.github.com/thomsmits/markdown_npp/master/obsidian_theme/userDefineLang.xml)
   from GitHub to your computer.
2. Click Start > Run, and type (or paste in) `%APPDATA%\Notepad++`, then click OK.
   This will open the settings directory for Notepad++.
3. If it does not already exist, copy the downloaded `userDefineLang.xml` 
   file into the Notepad++ settings directory. Skip to step 7.
4. If it _does_ exist, open the active `userDefineLang.xml` with a text editor.
5. Copy the contents of the Markdown definition file between the 
   `<UserLang...></UserLang>` tags into the active `userDefineLang.xml`, at the end right 
   before `</NotepadPlus>`.
6. Save `userDefineLang.xml`.
7. Restart Notepad++.
